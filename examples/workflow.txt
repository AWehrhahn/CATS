Input:
    - Observations / Simulations

Step 1: Determine tellurics:
    - observations are all in the telescope restframe
    - Determine airmass
    - Interpolate between models
    OR:
    - Fit tellurics to observations somehow

Step 2: Determine stellar parameters
    - Shift all observations into stellar/barycentric restframe
    - Mask regions with strong telluric features
    - Use only regions with clear continuum
    - Use PySME to fit stellar parameters
    
Step 3: Prepare models
    - Get MARCS model for the found stellar parameters
    - Calculate best PySME model
    - Calcualate PySME specific intensities

Step 4: Normalize observations
    - Normalize the observations to (stellar * telluric) spectrum
    - dont forget to shift the stellar frames to the telescope restframe

Step 5: Determine planet transit
    - Median along the spectral axis to determine the planet absorption in each observation
    - Fit that with transit model to obtain best fit transit time and radial velocity

Step 6: Extract Planet spectrum
    - shift all observations and models to the planet restframe
    - Use inverse problem minimization to find the best fit spectrum
